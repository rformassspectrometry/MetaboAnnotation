Package: MetaboAnnotation
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.4
Description:
    High level functions to assist in annotation of (metabolomics) data sets.
    These include functions to perform simple tentative annotations based on
    mass matching but also functions to consider m/z and retention times for
    annotation of LC-MS features given that respective reference values are
    available. In addition, the function provides high-level functions to
    simplify matching of LC-MS/MS spectra against spectral libraries and objects
    and functionality to represent and manage such matched data.
